# Strobe tuner
An attempt to simulate a strobe tuner. Currently (the SDL version) works only with generated pure sine waves - you can change the wheel frequency with left/right arrow, and you can see nicely how the wheel drifts depending on the frequency.

I'm in the middle of making the app work with WebAssembly, so that I can use the WebAudio API in the future, and have it work on mobile as well.
