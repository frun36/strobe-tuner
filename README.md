# Strobe tuner
An attempt to simulate a strobe tuner. Doesn't work particularly well - after being given a 20 Hz sine wave it works well enough so that you can at least see the principle (use the arrows to change wheel speed). Framerate seems to be a big limitation - I will probably have to abandon the real-time nature of the display and focus on showing a shorter sample in a longer time period.
